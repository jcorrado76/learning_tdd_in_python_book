This repo contains the work and notes I've taken while working through the Test Driven Development in Python book, by 
Saleem Siddiqui.

This book can be found [here](https://www.amazon.com/Learning-Test-Driven-Development-Polyglot-Uncluttered/dp/1098106474/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3G3Y5Q7IYEWQX&keywords=learning+test+driven+development&qid=1637023543&sprefix=Learning+Test+Driven+%2Caps%2C334&sr=8-3).

In each chapter, there's a README containing my notes and anything learned during that chapter in this book.
In addition, there is a running list of features that was implemented in the example used in the book in each README.
