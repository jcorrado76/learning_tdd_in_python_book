This is going to be the work for chapter 2 of the **Learning Test Driven Development in Python** book.

We've copied our list of features from chapter 1 so we can continue working on them here. 

* 5 USD X 2 = 10 USD - Done in Chapter 1
* 10 EUR X 2 = 20 EUR
* 4002 KRW / 4 = 1000.5 KRW
* 5 USD + 10 EUR = 17 USD
* 1 USD + 1100 KRW = 2200 KRW


We're going to start with working on the second feature in this chapter.
