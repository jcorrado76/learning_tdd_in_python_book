This is going to be the work for chapter 7 of the **Learning Test Driven Development in Python** book.

* 5 USD X 2 = 10 USD - Done in Chapter 1
* 10 EUR X 2 = 20 EUR - Done in Chapter 2
* 4002 KRW / 4 = 1000.5 KRW - Done in Chapter 2
* 5 USD + 10 USD = 15 USD - Done in Chapter 3
* Separate test code from production code
* Remove redundant tests
* 5 USD + 10 EUR = 17 USD
* 1 USD + 1100 KRW = 2200 KRW

We are going to separate our classes into separate modules, and then separate our tests into a separate module.
