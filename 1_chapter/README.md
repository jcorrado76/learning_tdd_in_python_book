This is going to be the work for chapter 1 of the **Learning Test Driven Development in Python** book.

The problem we're solving here is the time-test classic of creating a multi-currency calculator.

In this chapter, we've encoded our features as a list of requirements, or statements that we should be able to perform.

* 5 USD X 2 = 10 USD - Done
* 10 EUR X 2 = 20 EUR
* 4002 KRW / 4 = 1000.5 KRW
* 5 USD + 10 EUR = 17 USD
* 1 USD + 1100 KRW = 2200 KRW
